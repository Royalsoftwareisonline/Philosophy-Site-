        <h1>Big wacky crazy philosophy project extraordinare!</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the starting <br> point of my crazy project!
	<br> (map included). The project <br> starts with the video file.
	<br> The live action in-between <br> sections are "layer 1" while
	<br> each "part" (the meat of the <br> project) is a seperate thing. 
	<br> Think about it like that movie <br> inception, or layers on a cake.
	<br> The end of the project is called <br> "layer 2" to signify that it's the
	<br> ending, but also because it is in <br> a different emotional and 
	<br> physical space than layer 1 <br> (you'll see what I mean).</p>
	
		<div class="side-paragraph"> As you can see, part 5 branches off from the rest. <br> That is because it is on a seperate website. It is 
	<br> Technically optional but encouraged (I spent a <br> lot of time on it!)</div>
